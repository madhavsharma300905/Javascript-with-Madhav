// The datatypes are basically divided into two types on the basis of their value is stored in the memory and accessed from the memory.

// Interview related questions
// - primitive and Nonprimitive (call by value, call by reference)
// - primitive:7 (call by value)
// - string, number, boolean, null(Empty), undefined, symbol , BigInt
// - Nonprimitive:3 (call by reference)
// - arrays, object, function

// - Dynamically type vs statically type - js is dynamically typed

//In Primitive datatype they are called by value datatypes that means you can perform changes on the copied value original value remain unchanged
//In NonPrimitive datatype they  are called by reference datatypes that means you perform changes on the original value and the original value get changed.

// Primitive data type goes to Stack we get a copy of that value.
// Non-Primitive data type goes to Heap we get reference of that value.

/*1) Primitive Datatypes
       Number => number
       String  => string
       Boolean  => boolean
       null  => object
       undefined  =>  undefined
       Symbol  =>  symbol
       BigInt  =>  bigint

2) Non-primitive Datatypes
       Arrays  =>  object
       Function  =>  function
       Object  =>  object*/
